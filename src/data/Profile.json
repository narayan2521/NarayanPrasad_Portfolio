    "In my current role, Iâ€™ve built reusable component libraries, integrated APIs, debugged complex issues, and optimized UI performance across multiple client-facing projects. I'm especially strong in JavaScript and love finding the cleanest, most efficient solution to a problem.",
    "I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and staying up-to-date with best practices. Whether it's building a finance dashboard, a job automation tool, or a custom ROI calculator, I always aim for user-friendly interfaces and responsive designs.",
    "Outside of coding, Iâ€™m self-motivated and constantly learning â€” right now Iâ€™m leveling up my skills to break into a higher package role. Iâ€™m not afraid to get my hands dirty, explore DevOps, or automate a few things if it helps the project scale."
